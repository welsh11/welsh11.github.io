At the beginning of 2022 I made the risky decision to create a list of goals for the year that would hopfully push me forwards a bit to becoming an indy developer.

Here's a screenshot:

Intention was to:

* Do some Youtube dev videos
* Build and release my podcast app side project (Podthing) - with the intention of...
* Using it to create a course on Udemy where we would build the app from start to finish
* Start a second product (lol)
* Create a development blog

You will note that none of those ever got checked off or even moved to 'In Progress'!

A bit fat FAIL on this then?

Looking back on the year, it was pretty eventful and incredibly busy. Most of these Goals are many hours of hard work and to be honest it was I had the dual menace of 'not enough hours in the day' and 'can't be arsed' to contend with. None of this was ever going to happen.....and I probably knew it at the time.

So let's look forwards and not backwards.

This **second** post in the blog (yes second) counts almost towards starting a devlog, although I haven't yet published a line of code, and I have started the second product - which in itself is a lie because you can't release a second product if you haven't yet released a *first* one, but something is underway that isn't the intended thing!

But I digress. Goals for 2023 are going to be a bit simpler:

Oh, and get healthy and lose weight....but I always want to do that!

Easy!
